        BalduchColab is a note-taking app that allows you to create and manage
        notes using blocks. The app is totally decentralized thanks to the
        Peritext protocol.

        Peritext is an algorithm for rich-text collaboration that provides
        greater flexibility: it allows users to edit independent copies of a
        document, and it provides a mechanism for automatically merging those
        versions back together in a way that preserves the usersâ€™ intent as much
        as possible. Once the versions are merged, the algorithm guarantees that
        all users converge towards the same merged result.
